Pump it Up: Data Mining the Water Table

# How the data was acquired:

This project was for a competition on datadriven.org. The website describes itself as: 

"DrivenData works on projects at the intersection of data science and social impact, in areas like international development, health, education, research and conservation, and public services."

Companies, non-profits and governments of high paid prizes in order to have data scientist compete in order to figure out real world problems.The data for this project was acquired from the Tanzania Ministry of Water and the Taarifa Platform. The Taarifa Platform is an open source API designed to use citizen feedback on local problems. The competition and the data can be found at the link below:

# Task/Goal

- Use machine learning models to predict the functionality of all ground water pumps found throughout the country of Tanzania.
- Accurate models can help to cut the cost on needing workers drive out to every water pump to inspect them.
- The government can use this study to know exactly which pumps are working, need repair and which ones arenâ€™t working at all.
